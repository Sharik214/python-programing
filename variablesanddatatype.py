#first we discusss about what is variable and datatype
#variables=> to aclocatted memory for storing different data types or variable is like a continer to store data/elements
#suppose
a=10#this is integer data type
print(a)
b="hello"#this is string datatype
print(b)
# now what is data type =>specfic the type  vaules a variable holds
#a=10->integer
#b="hello"-> string
#c=ture-> boolean

#for complex number
complex(1,3)# you can't writen a=1,2 it show error 
#for float
a=1.1
print(a)
#now we are trying to know more datatypes
#lists-> in python list are known collection of different datetypes but are mutable.now what mutable simply which are changed .
#example 
list1=[4,2,3,[4,-5],["apple","banana"]]
print(list1)
#tuples is same as a list but they are unmutble(which cann't be change) and syntex change.
#example
tuple1=("Parrot","Sparrow"),("loin","tiger")
print(tuple1)
#dictionary->collection of key value pair 
#like man with has name,age and rollnumber
dict1={"name":"sharik" , "age":19 , "roll number":65 }
print(dict1)
